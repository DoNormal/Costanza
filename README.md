Costanza
========
Your favourite short, stocky, slow-witted and bald friend for .NET and ASP.NET MVC.
More clearly: it’s a utility library that adds small improvements to the .NET framework and ASP.NET MVC.

The reasoning behind the name: it's a tribute to one of the greatest characters ever created in television, George Costanza. 
Like George, to many this library may seem useless at first. However, prolonged exposure will eventually lead to a meaningful friendship.
