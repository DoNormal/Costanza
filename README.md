Costanza
========
Your favourite short, stocky, slow-witted and bald friend for .NET and ASP.NET MVC.
More clearly: a utility library you might find useful when you're building software with .NET/ASP.NET MVC.


Features for ASP.NET MVC
--------
 - Common route constraints.
 - Custom ActionResults.
 - Helpful extensions to `UrlHelper` and `HtmlHelper`.

And more. Read the [full documentation of Costanza.Mvc](https://github.com/versolamorte/costanza/blob/master/docs/Costanza.Mvc.md).


Features for general .NET development
--------
 - Exception-free conversion from `string` and `object`, to other common data types, like `int` and `decimal`.
 - Perform calculations with dates.
 - Helpful extension methods for `string`.
 - Create transactions with the right transaction settings.

License
--------
Let's keep lawyers out of code. There's no actual license. Just use the code however you want. You don't even have to mention you got it from me. Still, that would be a nice gesture on your part.
